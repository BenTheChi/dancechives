# Vision
There is a lot of footage of dance competitions out on Youtube and Facebook, but no centralized place that tracks them.  The goal of this project is to develop an ar-chive for street and club dancers to track competitions, battles, and dancers. It will keep track of statistics, footage, locations, dates, styles, and various other dance related metadata.  The site will depend on user submitted data collection with trusted admins and moderators monitoring the integrity of said data.  Both the development and use of this site will be user and community driven.

The first phase of this project is to complete the dancechives-api and connect it to DynamoDB to establish a back end.
The second phase of this project will be to develop a React or Angular based front end.

# Contributing
The project is currently not open to contribution, but it will be soon!  This is my first time with open source so I need to establish some base code and project structure first.  If you're interested in contributing please e-mail me at benthechi@gmail.com.

# Message from the creator
This is my first open source project and the timeline for this project will probably be more than a couple years.  I will make mistakes.  I will probably accidentally let bad code get merged in that will break everything at some point, drastically change designs, or not have any idea how to do or fix something at some point.  But creating this means a lot to me and I know it has the potential to drastically change the freestyle dance community.  I promise I will do my best and I know that with the help of the open source dance community we can make this dream a reality!  I believe communication is key to success so I will always be responsive and open to feedback.  It will be an ongoing learning experience for all of us.  Thank you for joining me on this open source adventure!
