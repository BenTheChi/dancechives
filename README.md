# Vision
There is a lot of footage of dance competitions out on Youtube and Facebook, but no centralized place that tracks them.  The goal of this project is to develop an ar-chive for street and club dancers to track competitions, battles, and dancers. It will keep track of statistics, footage, locations, dates, styles, and various other dance related metadata.

The first phase of this project is to complete the dancechives-api and connect it to DynamoDB to establish a back end.
The second phase of this project will be to develop a React or Angular based front end.

# Contributing
The project is currently not open to contribution, but it will be soon!  This is my first time with open source so I need to establish some base code and project structure first.  If you're interested in contributing please e-mail me at benthechi@gmail.com.
